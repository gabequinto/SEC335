In this lab we were focusing on DNS enumeration. We were first tasked with creating a script to scan a network by passing a network prefix and port to scan for DNS. That can be found by clicking [here](https://github.com/gabequinto/SEC335/blob/main/week3/portscanner2.sh). Following this we were to create a script that could take a given network prefix and a given dns server and perform an nslookup to find DNS servers on that given network. That script can be found [here](https://github.com/gabequinto/SEC335/blob/main/week3/dns-resolver.sh). Following this we were tasked with finding DNS servers using Nmap. The way I completed this was first by running the command `sudo nmap -R -Pn --open 10.0.5.0/24 -p 53 -oG - | awk '/Up$/{print $2}' | sudo tee -a dns-servers2.txt`. Than you are able to simply run the command `cat dns-servers2.txt` to see the IP address of these servers. Next we were tasked with figuring out a way to run a reverse lookup with Nmap while parsing the output to only include the hostname and the associated IP address. To do this I ran the command `sudo nmap -sL 10.0.5.0/24 --dns-servers 10.0.5.22 | grep "local" | awk {'print $5","$6'}`. Finally, we performed a zone transfer which I had never heard of before. Once we completed this transfer we were tasked with parsing the file 'zt.txt' to display the hostnames and associated IP addresss. In order to get the desired output I ran the command `cat zt.txt | grep -E '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' | awk {'print $1","$5} | grep -v ";"`.
