For this lab we were tasked with setting up our own home lab for pentesting purposes. This lab includes one VYOS box, one Kali Linux box, one xubuntu box, and one vulnerable 
centos box. After configuring all of these machines we had to configure a WireGuard VPN for connectivity between our Kali box and our vulnerable box.
