### Overview
------
For this lab we were tasked with setting up our own home lab for pentesting purposes. This lab includes one VYOS box, one Kali Linux box, one xubuntu box, and one vulnerable 
centos box. After configuring all of these machines we had to configure a WireGuard VPN for connectivity between our Kali box and our vulnerable box. 

### Reflection
------
This was a very fun lab and the first time I had set up VM's in this manner. I have never configured VM's to be able to have connectivity to eachother, however I'm glad that we did this lab because it will be very helpful in the future. It will for sure pay off in the future to be able to do this for whatever the situation may call for.
