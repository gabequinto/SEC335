### Reflections
--------
This was the definetaly the most challenging lab to date. I got stuck when trying to gain the initial foothold on the system. I was unaware that I needed to use metaslpoit and once I learned that from peers, the next challenge was learning how to use metasploit as I have never used it before. After I got comfortable with metasploit it was fairly simple to load the right module and set all of the correct options. Those were really the only issues that I had with this target. One thing the sysadmins could have done much better is taknig away the world-writable permissions of /etc/passwd. This would have stopped root compromise from happening. As well, updating the version of phpmyadmin would not allow for the metasploit exploit to run.
