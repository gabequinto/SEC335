### Port Scanning 1
------
For this lab we were port scanning with Nmap and Wireshark. We first ran the command `bash -c "echo >/dev/tcp/10.0.5.20/80"` while recording in wireshark to be 
able to view the TCP flags during the connection and teardown of a tcp connection. Following this we were given a script that checked what hosts had which ports open. We then had to modify the script
to add things like error and options checking. I will have a link to that file
