### Overview 
------
For this lab we were tasked with exploting a webserver named "cupcake.shire.local". This is a local web server that was made our class to be able to exploit. We started with running 
active reacon against this server to attempt to find what ports were open as well as any applications running. We then learned how to export the results of our Nmap scans to a .csv
file which makes it much easier to parse than outputing the results to the command line. This is very helpful if you run a command that has a very large output. Following this we 
started to look for any vulernabilities we could exploit in order to leverage to get on the server. After finding this exploit we were able to execute code remotely and use this
to find the users and build a password list in order to be able to login to the server. After logging in we were tasked with gaining root access on this server. A more detailed 
explination of each section will be outlined below. 

### Reflection
------
This lab was incredibly fun and the first time dipping my feet into exploiting a server. I didn't have to many problems with this lab, however I did have to use google a lot just to
find the correct syntax of each command. One thing that I did have a little trouble finding was the location of the resources we were running the remote code on. For example I was unaware
that the
